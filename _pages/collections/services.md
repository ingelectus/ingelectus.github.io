## [Grid Integration Studies](/services/grid-integration-studies/){:class="text-dark"}

Grid integration studies is a service that analyzes the behavior and the impact of new elements installed in the transmission system networks. Modelling and simulating grid elements in a specific software tool (such as PSS/E® and DIgSilent, PSCAD, ATP, among others) used for electrical transmission network, Ingelectus provides a complete overview of the status of the grid.

## [Modelling and Simulation](/services/modelling-and-simulation/){:class="text-dark"}

Electrical devices modelling and simulation is a service that provide software models of actual power-electronics-based devices and power plant controls by mimicking its behaviour on standard electrical system simulation software, such as PSS/E®, DIgSilent and Matlab/Simulink. Thus, Ingelectus provides a complete overview of the devices (PV, ESS, STATCOM, among others) and power plant controllers (PPC).
