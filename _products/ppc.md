# Introduction

Ingelectus PPC is a reliable and flexible solution that is able to control a series of different element present in PV and Wind power plants to achieve TSO (Transmission System Operator) or DSO (Distribution System Operator) requirements at the POI (Point of Interconnection). 
This system is capable of meeting the international requirements for grid stability management using closed loop controls offering the following functionalities:
* Active Power Reference, with or without ramp rate limiter (increase or decrease if its possible). 
* Active Power Curtailment, with or without ramp rate limiter.
* Frequency response depending on the frequency deviations. 
* Voltage Control. AVR (Automatic Voltage Regulator)
* Reactive Power control. 
* Power factor control.

## Flexible:

It is suitable for controlling solar photovoltaic plants (PV) with different type inverters (regardsless of the manufacturers), Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) or Capacitor Banks. 

Standard comunication protocols like: SunSpec Modbus TCP, DNP3, IEC 61850, OPC, etc.

## Customizing functionalities

Ingelectus PPC can be adapted to to comply with the most demanding grid codes: Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) technical interconnection  requirements, National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) grid connection code for renewable power plants, Centro Nacional de Control de Energía (México’s ISO), Red Electrica de España (REE, Spanish TSO), techcnical requirements of Comisión Nacional de Energía (CNE, Chile), United States: The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, etc.  

## Ingelectus Experience

Ingelectus PPC is controlling successfully up to 130 MW in the United States and Mexico. 

Sending reports and main signals to a SCADA manufactured by Isotrol.

Different solar inverters controlled: Ingeteam, SMA and KACO.

Functionalities already in use:

* Active Power Curtailment, with ramp rate limiter.
* Frequency response depending on the frequency deviations. 
* Voltage Control. 
* Reactive Power control. 
* Power factor control.


## Intuitive web interface

Made specially for power plant operators it gives a global view of the hole solar plant paying special attention to what is happening at the point of interconnection and the solar inverters. Very useful during commissioning of the power plant and specially to check TSO functionality requirements. It has the possibility of exporting data to excel files to analyze different events.
