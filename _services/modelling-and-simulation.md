# Introduction
Electrical devices modelling and simulation is a service that provide software models of actual power-electronics-based devices and power plant controls by mimicking its behaviour on standard electrical system simulation software, such as PSS/E®, DIgSilent and Matlab/Simulink. Thus, Ingelectus provides a complete overview of the devices (PV, ESS, STATCOM, among others)  and power plant controllers (PPC).

## Service description
Models match the behaviour of electrical devices or power plant controllers so that you can use these models on standard electrical power systems software such as PSS/E® or DIgSilent. Simulations in these software platforms with the custom models are the best  approach to the actual behaviour during electromechanical events. With these simulations you can analyze and prove the compliance of Grid Code Requirements. 

## Objects
### Electrical devices
The service offers models for different electrical devices: 
*	Photovoltaic Generator 
*	Wind Turbine Generator 
*	Power Converter 
*	Energy management Systems (EMS)
*	Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)
*	Static synchronous compensator (STATCOM)


### Control systems
The service offers power plant controllers to provide the TSO desired behaviour.
*	Power plant controller (PPC)


## Features and functionalities
Among the different features and functionalities  that the models provide are:

### Electrical devices

*	Thermal operating limits
